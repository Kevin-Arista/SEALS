                    <h3>Reason</h3>
                    <p>Hello, My name is Kevin Arista and I am 16 years old. 
                       I would describe my level of creativty as innovative. 
                       I beleive that you shouldn't be held back in life due to something you don't know how or aren't used to doing.
                       Furthermore, I chose this image that contains many tools because as someone who want to be innovative, will always create anything with the given tools, despite not knowing how to use them.</p>

                <h5>Reflection</h5>
                <p>To be honest, the first week of SCLA has not been what I expected. 
                   I underestimated the amount of work they would give us.
                   However, I am happy to say, that I have been able to keep up for the most part - soon to change, I will strive to make progress. 
                   I am also amazed to know the amount of hours I have spent alongside with my fellow brothers outside of class time to work on the challenges we have been given.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reflect">
                    <h5>Reflection</h5>
                    <p>Furthermore, with just two classes, I have learned alot. 
                        From the experinces that I have had with my brothers to the experinces I have had in coding and to the experiences I have had in leadership. 
                        For example, I learned that Gabriel play really beutiful the guitar (I heard it on his Instagram page). In the coding aspect I have reviewed many elements that are vital in the process of developing a website, so I am thankful for our teacher, Bernal. Furthermorem in the leadership sessions, I have learned from Oscar that we should always respond by being detailed and never just be broad because people may misinterpret you.
                        Furthermore, I have also been able to  learn many life lessons as seen in the Alchemist (I have finished reading it - still need The Art OF War). 
                        From the Alchemist, I liked a phrase "The secret of Hapiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never forget the drops of oil on the spoon." - by the wise man in the story Melchizedik told Santiago. 
                        I interpreted this quote - such that in life, you are always free to joy and take time for self-awareness, but you should never forget about your purpose, don't ever get distracted or divert your attention from your task or goal or Personal Legend. </p>
