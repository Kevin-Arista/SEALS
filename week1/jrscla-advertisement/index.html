            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <p>Hello my name is Kevin Arista and I was a 10th grader when I joined SCLA for the summer of 2020.  I met other young males of color and we learned the basics of coding through challenges to prepare us for our main goal - to build an application that would help our community. Can you imagine, saying that when you were in middle school you developed an app that helped your community?! As the software developer in my team, I developed the code of our app called Street Hub using MEANStack which is a set of coding languages used to develop an app. This experience taught me certain tools that professionals at Google, Snapchat, and Instagram use! I also learned and had fun working with my teammates.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 col3">
            <h4>Knowledge</h4>
            <p>In Conclusion, Jr.SCLA is a program for thriving young middle school kids of color.
